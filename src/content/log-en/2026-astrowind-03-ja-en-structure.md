## ■ Purpose

In an AstroWind-based site, separate Japanese and English using the `/ja/` and `/en/` directories, allowing the following elements to be managed independently for each language:

- Navigation (Header / Footer)
- Layout (loaded navigation and text)
- SEO (canonical / hreflang / html lang)

---

## ■ Background

- Pages are separated by language using `/ja/` and `/en/` directories.
- Navigation is split into `navigation-ja.ts` and `navigation-en.ts`.
- Page layouts are separated into `PageLayout_Ja.astro` and `PageLayout_En.astro`, switching which navigation file is loaded.
